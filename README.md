## Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

### Projects

### Project 1: Fraud Checks
- Description: In this project, I used the Random Forest ML Model to predict the likelihood of person committing fraud.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Results: Achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting if a person is committing a fraud.

### Project 2: Natural gas consumption in USA
- Description: Conducted sentiment analysis on Natural gas consumption dataset to find out the Average Natural Gas Consumption for each Zip Code in USA grouped by Building Type.
- Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Tableau
