## Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

### Projects

### Project 1: Fraud Checks
[View Project here](https://github.com/Truth300/truth_data/blob/main/Fraud_Check.ipynb)
- Description: In this project, I used the Random Forest ML Model to predict the likelihood of person committing fraud.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Results: Achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting if a person is committing a fraud.
